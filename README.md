# SolMint Launchpad Pro

Create SPL meme coins on **Solana mainnet** — no code required. Non-custodial,
wallet-signed. This is the **public/paid edition**: on top of Solana's own
network fees and account rent, it charges a platform fee of **0.2 SOL per
token created**, plus **0.05 SOL per authority revoked** (mint / freeze /
update), sent to the platform wallet configured in
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET`.

## What it does

- Connect a wallet (Phantom, Solflare, and any Wallet Standard wallet such as
  Backpack, Glow, or Trust Wallet — auto-detected in-browser)
- Fill in token details (name, symbol, description, decimals, supply, logo,
  socials)
- Logo + metadata JSON are uploaded to IPFS via Pinata
- The app builds the mint + metadata + mint-to-recipient transaction; **your
  wallet signs it locally** — the app never sees a private key or seed phrase
- Optionally revoke mint authority, freeze authority, and/or metadata update
  authority in a second signed transaction
- Get the token address, transaction signature, and Explorer links; history
  is kept locally in your browser

## Tech stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS
- `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token`
- `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata` (via Umi) for on-chain metadata
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-*` for wallet connections
- Pinata for IPFS pinning (proxied through a server API route so the API key
  never reaches the browser)

### A note on the token program

The brief mentioned Token-2022. This build uses the **classic SPL Token
program** (`TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID`) with Metaplex Token Metadata, which is the
combination with the broadest wallet, explorer, and DEX support today (this
is the same approach pump.fun-style launchpads use). Token-2022 adds
extensions (transfer fees, transfer hooks, metadata-in-mint, etc.) that
aren't needed for a standard meme coin and meaningfully increase integration
risk with wallets/DEXs that don't yet fully support every extension. If you
want a Token-2022 variant, `lib/mint.ts` is the only file that needs to
change — swap the SPL Token instructions for their `spl-token` Token-2022
equivalents and use `mpl-token-metadata`'s Token-2022 metadata pointer flow.

## Platform fees — how they work in code

`lib/fees.ts` defines the fee constants (`PLATFORM_CREATION_FEE_SOL = 0.2`,
`PLATFORM_REVOKE_FEE_SOL = 0.05`), and `lib/network.ts` defines the
destination wallet (`PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET`, overridable via
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET`). `lib/mint.ts` inserts a transfer
instruction to that wallet in the same transaction the user is already
signing — no extra approval step, and the exact amount is always visible in
the wallet's confirmation screen before signing. Search the repo for
`transferSol` / `SystemProgram.transfer` to see every fee instruction.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local — see below
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

### Required environment variables

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PINATA_JWT` | Yes | Server-only. Create a free Pinata account, generate a JWT with `pinFileToIPFS` + `pinJSONToIPFS` scopes. |
| `PINATA_GATEWAY` | No | Defaults to `gateway.pinata.cloud`. Use your own dedicated gateway if you have one. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` | Recommended | Defaults to the public `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` endpoint, which is heavily rate-limited and **not suitable for production**. Get a free/paid endpoint from Helius, QuickNode, Triton, or similar. |

This app talks to **Solana mainnet-beta only**. Every token created is real
and immediately tradable. Test with small amounts first.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it in Vercel.
3. Add the three environment variables above in Project Settings →
   Environment Variables.
4. Deploy. No other configuration is needed — the app is a standard Next.js
   15 App Router project.

## Security notes

- The app never requests, stores, or transmits a seed phrase or private key.
- All signing happens inside the user's own wallet extension/app.
- The Pinata JWT lives only in server environment variables and is used
  from the `/api/upload` route — it is never sent to the client.
- Revoking an authority is irreversible; the UI says so before the user
  confirms, and the app never pre-checks a box the user didn't choose except
  for sensible, clearly-labeled defaults (mint + freeze revoked by default,
  update authority left mutable by default) that the user can change.
